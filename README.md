*Idawi* is a Java decentralized middleware for distributed applications. It is developed at the
[Computer Science Laboratory of the Universté Côte d'Azur](http://www.i3s.unice.fr/en/comredEn) ([Nice](https://www.google.com/maps/@43.5168069,6.6753034,5633a,35y,67.34h,76.97t/data=!3m1!1e3), France),
a joint lab of [Cnrs](https://www.cnrs.fr) and [Inria Sophia Antipolis](https://www.inria.fr).

*Idawi* is described in this [draft](http://www.i3s.unice.fr/~hogie/idawi.pdf).

Its most notable features include:
- native group-based stream/object-oriented asynchronous/synchronous communication model
- fully [decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralised_system) P2P [service-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture) architecture
- independance to transport network (includes support for SSH, TCP and UDP)
- massive [lock-free](https://preshing.com/20120612/an-introduction-to-lock-free-programming/) multi-core parallelism
- ability to do emulation
- automatized deployment/bootstrapping of nodes through SSH
- REST-based web interface

Target applications for *Idawi* include distributed computing, High Performance Computing (HPC), Internet of Things (IOT), Fog and Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence (IA), Research in distributed/parallel algorithms, and emulation.
