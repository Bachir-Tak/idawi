*Idawi* is a Java decentralized middleware for distributed applications. It is developed at the
[Computer Science Laboratory of the Universté Côte d'Azur](http://www.i3s.unice.fr/en/comredEn) [Nice](https://www.google.com/maps/@43.5168069,6.6753034,5633a,35y,67.34h,76.97t/data=!3m1!1e3), France,
which is a joint lab of [Cnrs](https://www.cnrs.fr) and [Inria Sophia Antipolis](https://www.inria.fr).

*Idawi* is extensively described in the on-going working paper there:
